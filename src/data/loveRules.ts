    subtitle: "Preparing for Love - Solitude Before Partnership",
    description: "The first rule establishes that true preparation for love begins not with searching for another person, but with becoming comfortable, confident, and self-aware in one's own company. You must consciously transform the fear of loneliness into the power of solitude. As Paul Tillich said: 'Language has created the word loneliness to express the pain of being alone. And it has created the word solitude to express the glory of being alone.'",

      "Transform from seeking completion in others to feeling whole within yourself"

    subtitle: "Healing Your Past - Understanding Your Patterns",
    description: "Our past experiences create unconscious patterns (samskaras) that dictate our present and future relationship choices. This rule focuses on examining and learning from these patterns to break negative cycles. Karma is presented as a feedback loop: Impression ‚Üí Choice ‚Üí Effect ‚Üí New Impression. The same painful patterns will repeat until the underlying samskara is examined and a new choice is made.",

    description: "Love is not a singular event but a multi-phased journey. Significant misunderstanding arises when partners are in different phases but use the same phrase 'I love you.' This rule introduces the Four Phases of Love: Attraction, Dreams, Struggle & Growth, and Trust. Each phase requires different skills and awareness to navigate successfully.",
    keyPoints: [

    subtitle: "Learning Through Love - Mutual Growth and Teaching",
    description: "The most meaningful relationships are those where partners serve as both teacher and student for each other, fostering continuous mutual growth. Your partner acts as a mirror, reflecting your strengths and areas for improvement with unique clarity. There are three ways to learn: with someone, from someone, and through someone (the most challenging but profound).",

    description: "The highest form of love is achieved not by finding or receiving it, but by creating and giving it freely to everyone, all the time. This represents the Sannyasa stage - moving from seeking love to being love. Love expands in concentric circles: loved ones, colleagues, community, strangers, and the earth itself.",

      title: "A Journey Through the Four Ashrams of Love",
      content: "Built upon the ancient Vedic concept of four life stages (ashrams), this framework presents love as four distinct 'classrooms': Brahmacharya (preparing for love through solitude), Grhastha (practicing love in partnership), Vanaprastha (protecting love through healing), and Sannyasa (perfecting love through universal service). Love is not just an emotion‚Äîit's a practice, a discipline, and a way of being that starts with the most important relationship of all: the one with yourself."

    conclusion: {
      title: "From Seeking Love to Being Love",
      content: "The ultimate message is one of profound empowerment. Love is not a finite resource to be hoarded but an infinite, self-generating energy that grows the more it is given away. By following these eight rules, you move from wishing for love to actively creating it every day, transforming your relationship with yourself, your partner, and the world. This is the perfection of love‚Äîtransforming it from something you get into something you are."
